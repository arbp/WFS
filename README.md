Windows Functionality Suite

The Windows Functionality Suite (previously known as the Win32 Declare Library) is a collection of Windows-specific functionality that is not readily available in a free format. It is an open source collaboration that brings to users all of the specialized Windows functionality that is not included with Xojo \ Real Studio itself.
